# Neptyne
Neptyne is a simple programming language created just for fun and learning the compile process.

## Syntax example
The syntax is a bit inspired from C and Python mixed.
```c
bring system;

string hello = "Hello world!";

// This will print out the 'hello' variable to the console
out(hello);

int n = 7;
if n == 7: {
    n++;
}
else: {
    out("The number wasn't 7...");
}

while n > 2: {
    n--;
}

out("The number is now " + n + "!");
```
